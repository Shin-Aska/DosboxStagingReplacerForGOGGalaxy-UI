## Antivirus detection

This script may contain code that will get flagged by your antivirus. If this happens, mark it as a false positive.
I strongly recommend you to check the code and understand what it does before running it. I have added comments to the code to help you understand it.

Instead of embedding the UI, I purposefully kept it separate to allow for easy updates, modifications and inspection of the code. This way, you can easily see what the script does and how it works.
